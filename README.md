Work in Progress

A Discord bot that can answer questions with answers drawn from wiki’s. Right now I’m working w/ a fandom wiki for Pixar’s Cars 2 and answers are fairly generalized.

Eventual goals

-Have it reference relevant images in its answers

-Give it the ability to use headers from wiki trees to flag answers for better results. This would make it easier for users to ‘game’ it into giving more specifically useful results and allow for directly referential answers like clarifying a complex paragraph in a given page.
